### Refund Management (new file: refunds.py)
- `POST /stripe/refund` - Create refund for payment
- `GET /stripe/refund/{refund_id}` - Get refund status
- `PATCH /stripe/purchases/{id}/status` - Update purchase status in Supabase (pending â†’ refunded)

## Implementation Priority
1. Complete webhook handlers (critical for production)
2. Add payment intent endpoints (core payment flow)
3. Add account management endpoints (creator onboarding)
4. Add refund functionality (customer service)
5. Add balance/analytics endpoints (creator features)
6. Add fee calculation endpoints (transparency)

## Notes
- All new endpoints need:
  - Error handling
  - Rate limiting
  - Logging
  - Type validation
  - Authentication checks
  - Test coverage
  - Idempotency keys for POST requests
  - Proper response schemas
