"""Stripe Compliance Operations Module.

This module handles all compliance-related operations for Stripe connected accounts, including:
- Tax form generation and management
- Regulatory compliance checks
- Documentation requirements
- Compliance status monitoring

The module integrates with Stripe's API through the Stripe client to ensure proper handling of
compliance requirements for connected accounts. All operations are designed to provide clear
error handling and standardized responses for integration with the broader application.

Key Features:
- Tax document generation interface
- Compliance status tracking
- Error handling for Stripe API operations
- Standardized response formats

Note: This module is currently in development and some features are not yet implemented.

    This function initiates the tax form generation process for a given Stripe account.
    Currently serves as a placeholder implementation that will be expanded to handle:
    - Tax form type selection (1099, W-9, etc.)
    - Form data validation
    - Document generation
    - Delivery status tracking

    Args:
        stripe_account_id (str): The unique identifier of the Stripe account for which to
                               generate tax forms. Must be a valid Stripe account ID.

    Returns:
        tuple: A Flask response tuple containing:
            - JSON response with status information
            - HTTP status code (200 for success, 500 for errors)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided account ID is invalid or missing
        stripe.error.StripeError: For any Stripe API-related errors
        Exception: For any unexpected errors during processing

    Example:
        >>> response, status_code = generate_tax_form('acct_123456789')
